Sophie slept peacefully beside her girlfriend Jasmine, unaware of the horrors that were about to unfold. As the clock ticked closer to midnight, she felt a sudden jolt, as if someone had yanked the covers off the bed.

Blearily, she rubbed her eyes and sat up, trying to make sense of what was happening. That's when she saw two masked men in their bedroom, one holding a gun, and the other dragging Jasmine out of bed.

Sophie's heart raced as she realized what was happening. Her medical condition made her look like a child, and she knew that the men must have mistaken her for one. Fear and panic washed over her as she watched Jasmine being pulled out of the room and into the darkness beyond.

Sophie tried to call out to her girlfriend, but her voice was caught in her throat. She was frozen with fear, unable to move or act. All she could do was watch helplessly as the men took Jasmine away.

As the minutes ticked by, Sophie sat there in shock, unable to comprehend what was happening. She couldn't believe that someone had broken into their home and taken her girlfriend. All she could do was pray that Jasmine would be okay, and that the police would arrive soon to save her.

As Sophie sat there, her mind racing with fear, one of the masked men approached her. He began asking her questions in Russian, but Sophie couldn't understand a word he was saying. She tried to tell him that she didn't speak Russian, but he ignored her.

Suddenly, the man rolled Sophie onto her belly and pulled her hands behind her back, tying them with a zip tie. Sophie winced as the plastic dug into her skin, and she struggled to free herself. But it was no use, the man had tied her too tightly.

The man then pulled Sophie down to the footboard of the bed, putting her feet on either side of a metal bar. He tied her feet together with another zip tie, leaving her completely immobilized. Sophie was now completely helpless, and tears streamed down her face as she realized what was happening.

As the man left the room, Sophie heard something happening in the next room. She strained to hear, trying to make out what was going on. But all she could hear were muffled voices and shuffling footsteps.

Sophie's heart raced as she wondered what was happening to Jasmine. She prayed that her girlfriend was okay, and that she would come back to her soon. But as the minutes ticked by, Sophie began to lose hope. She was alone, helpless, and scared. All she could do was wait and hope that someone would come to rescue her.

Suddenly, the door to the bedroom opened and the masked man re-entered the room. He pressed the gun into Sophie's head and began to interrogate her in a thick Russian accent.

"How old are you?" he demanded.

"I'm 30," Sophie replied, her voice shaking with fear.

"What do you do for a living?" he asked.

"I work in a library," Sophie answered.

The man continued to press her for information, repeatedly asking about a USB device. But Sophie had no idea what he was talking about. She shook her head, tears streaming down her face.

"I don't know what you're talking about," she said.

The man grew angrier, pressing the gun harder into Sophie's head.

"You're lying," he spat. "We know you have it. Now tell me where it is!"

Sophie's heart raced as she realized that the men must have mistaken her for someone else. She had no idea what they were looking for, but she knew that she had to try and convince them that she wasn't who they thought she was.

"I swear, I don't have it," she said. "I don't know anything about a USB device. Please, you have to believe me!"

But the man didn't believe her. He continued to interrogate her, his voice growing louder and more menacing with each passing moment. Sophie closed her eyes and prayed for help, hoping that someone would come to her rescue before it was too late.

Sophie's heart sank as the man refused to believe her and instead cut her feet free from the bed. He forced her out of the bedroom and into the spare, empty bedroom, where Sophie saw Jasmine propped up against the far wall. Despite the situation, Sophie couldn't help but feel a tinge of excitement as she saw Jasmine tied up. It was rare for them to engage in these types of games, and the unpredictability of it all added a certain thrill to the experience.

Jasmine's feet were tied with zipties, and black tape was wrapped tightly around her head, covering her eyes and mouth. Sophie's stomach turned at the sight of Jasmine's struggle, and the masked man turned towards her, pulling out a roll of black tape. He wrapped it around Sophie's mouth, gagging her, but they ran out of tape, so they couldn't cover Sophie's eyes like they had done to Jasmine.

The man then propped Sophie up against the far wall, next to Jasmine, before leaving the room.

Sophie was left alone with her thoughts, unable to move or communicate with Jasmine. She felt a mix of fear and excitement as she sat there, adrenaline pumping through her veins. She wondered who these men were, what they wanted, and why they had targeted her and Jasmine. All she could do was hope and pray that someone would come to her rescue soon.
